# Hackable smart contract
This is a one time hackable smart contract that models after a vending machine(that gives out only peanut).

Just like the traditional vending machine, users will first deposit before buying peanuts from the contract, the least amount you can deposit before using the vending machine is 0.1 ether, this is because each peanut price is pegged at 0.1 ether. Users can also deposit more than the minimum amount requirement, purchase peanuts and withdraw any of their balance left from the contract.

Nonetheless there is a bug in the contract. The contract has a reserve balance of 1 ether, any hacker can penetrate this contract.

Figure out the bug in the contract and use it to your advantage.
